# Constitution
#### of the International Science Olympiads Discord Network
Version 1.2. Last updated Friday, 20 April 2020.

## Aims of the Network
This network unites several Discord Servers which have similar goals: that of bringing together students from all across the globe who are interested in one or more of the International Science Olympiads to a platform where they can meet, learn and socialise with other like-minded individuals.

As a network, we aim to facilitate the sharing and exchange of resources between member servers, and act as a committee which can make well-informed suggestions to member servers. The committee cannot enforce any member server to take any action.

## Voting Procedure
Votes will be posted in #com-voting. Each committee member will vote either with a thumbs up, shrug, or thumbs down. Votes may be submitted anonymously via ISODN bot. After 72 hours the vote passes if the sum of the votes is positive. In the case of a tie, the committee chair breaks the tie.

If a vote attains 2/3 majority before 3 days are up (not counting abstentions), then the vote may be passed instantly. 

Committee members can react with a speech bubble if they think the vote should be modified or there should be some further discussion. All committee members should vote on all votes.

## Prospective Member Servers
- **Requirements**   Should have at least 150 members, not including bots. Server structure and events should adhere to the guidelines below as closely as possible. Our network will only include one server for each Olympiad.
- **Procedure**   A vote will be taken as normal, except that the server must attain a 3/4 majority.
- **Upon acceptance**   Add server to portal. Make an announcement in every member server. Start a new dedicated page on the shared website. Server owner to be added to ISODN Committee, and to nominate other staff members from their server for vote.
- **Upon rejection**   If the rejection is due to them not following guidelines, then provide the prospective server with a rationale for their rejection. In any case, provide them with the exact number of votes for each option. 

## ISODN Committee
Each server will have the following number of seats in the committee:

| Verified Members | Seats |
|------------------|-------|
| 150+             | 2     |
| 500+             | 3     |
| 1500+            | 4     |
| 5000+            | 5     |

The owner of each member server should be on the ISODN committee. To fill the committee seats a server has, the server owner nominates other server members (usually staff) to be on the committee. If a committee member loses their staff position in their respective server, a standard anonymous vote is triggered, with the committee member in question not allowed to vote.

Committee members that are not server owners can resign at any time. In this case the server owner may nominate a new member of their server to be in the committee.

Committee members are expected to be active in their respective server and vote in every ISODN vote.

Each member server is expected to have an Observer role which gives owners of member servers (and optionally, other committee members), access to some staff channels. (Generally, the channels that a moderator can access).

All committee members must provide a valid Gmail so they can access the shared Google Drive.

All staff (admins and moderators) on member servers will be given the Admin or Mod role on ISODN, and will be allowed to view #com-announcements, #com-chat, and the voice chat com-munication.

## ISODN Committee Positions
All positions will be elected by anonymous vote once per year on July 1st, by a single transferable vote system. The following are a list of the positions and their roles and responsibilities.
- **Chair**   The chair represents and organises the committee, ensuring that everything is running smoothly and that all members are treated fairly. The chair owns the ISODN Server, and the previous chair must pass server ownership to the new chair. The Chair may break tied votes if necessary, but has no veto power.

## Losing Network Membership
A server can choose to drop out of the network. A server can also be voted out if there is dissatisfaction with the server.
- **Procedure**   A committee member will anonymously trigger an anonymous vote via the ISODN bot. Committee members from the server being voted on are not allowed to vote. A 2/3 majority is required from the remaining voters.
- **If the vote passes**   We undo each step in the "Upon acceptance" part of the "New Member Servers" section. The website is archived.

## Server Structure
All member servers should adhere to the following server structure as closely as possible.
- **Server name and icon**   Name should be <Topic> Olympiad or similar, official name should be <Topic> Olympiad Discord Server or similar. Icon should include all five Olympic colours and be themed on the server Olympiad topic.
- **Server Guidelines**   This should be standardised across the network as much as possible. See the SERVER GUIDELINES section below.
- **Categories**   An "info" category, a category for general chat, a category containing channels for each main subtopic of the Olympiad, a staff category. Each server event should also be housed in its own category.
- **Channels**   Rules (inc. verification), announcements, resources, network (inc. partners), general chat, memes/chill, general VC, subtopic-specific channels, spam, server suggestions. Each server event should also have its own channel(s).
- **Bots**   Each member should have the ISODN bot (once it exists). Servers with over 300 members should have a dedicated Staff Mail bot. Other useful optional bots include Paradox/Texit (use of mathbot is discouraged),  InviteManager, Zira (ties roles to reacts), and Rythm (for music).
- **Roles**   A coloured role should be related to server events or server positions, with the exception of supporters such as Patreon or Nitro boosters. Users should not be able to “select” a colour for vanity purposes.
- **Server positions**   Staff = {Admin, Moderator}, Helper Team = {Helper, optional other event helper roles}. Possible tech roles. All positions should require an application.
- **List of roles**   All server positions, server event roles, announcements role, Observer, muted, and unverified. Other possible roles include favourite subtopic roles.
- **Verification**   All servers should have a verification process upon joining the server. (This is very easy to set up.)
- **Partners**   A server should have a channel for partners, which should only be accepted on the basis that both servers are well-organised and are closely related in topic, and not for “advertisement” purposes. Otherwise we encourage the server to be listed as a resource or not at all.
- **Olympiad participants (optional)**   Servers may choose to verify Olympiad participants. If so, they should be minimally distinguishable from other members. However they should have their own private channels/category, and there should be a secret "Olympiad Participant directory" listing all verified participants and, if they agree, their real name/contestant info.

## Guidelines for Server Rules
When formulating the server rules, it is fine to recycle or reuse, in whole or in part, the rules of another member server. Server rules should address the following points:
- Reference the Discord Community Guidelines via a direct link.
- Be nice, be respectful (BNBR). This may include measures against flexing or showing off.
- Spamming, going off-topic, or posting inappropriate material.
- Minimodding
- Unwanted advertising
- Nickname policy
- Contest embargos

### In addition, some servers may find it useful to address the following points:
- Pinging the Helper role or other roles
- Spoilering content that might give away the solution to a problem.

## Shared Resources
- Shared event resources, such as templates, procedures, other misc tips and tricks.
- ISODN Bot with features: network bans, anonymous voting for the committee, tracking of edited and deleted messages.
- ISODN Website, where each member server can host their own webpage(s).
- Server rules, policies, punishments and bans. Punishments are standardised, and will be logged via the ISODN bot to a network database. Punishments such as mutes, kicks, and bans will also be network-wide.

## Possible server events
Servers with 300+ members should have some sort of POTD or weekly challenge. Some common events include:
- Problem of the Day
- Some sort of "Weekly challenge"
- Monthly individual/team contests
- Tutorials
- Social events
- Other misc games according to your Olympiad (e.g. I/O in MODS)

## Network-wide Partnerships
We will consider a network-wide partnership with another server or network. These will be featured on the portal server only (not member servers).
- **Requirements**   The server is about science in general, and would fit better on the portal server than in any one member server.
- **Procedure**   A vote will be taken as normal, except that a 2/3 majority must be attained.
- **Upon acceptance**   Add server or network to partnerships channel in portal server. Make an announcement in every member server. Update shared website.
- **Upon rejection**   Provide them with a rationale for their rejection.
